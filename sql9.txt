Sub queries when we write a query inside another query

Nested query 

select * from  table where condition = ( 
     select * from  table2 where conditon =
       (
         select * from  table 3
       ))

Sub queries  two types:

 Correlated queries
 Not correlated queries

Not correlated queries :
